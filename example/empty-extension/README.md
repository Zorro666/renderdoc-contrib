This extension is a completely empty example showing the bare bones of what is needed to register an extension with RenderDoc and get a callback to run custom code.

For more information see [How do I register a python extension?](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_python_extension.html) on the process of registering this extension with the UI, and [Writing UI extensions](https://renderdoc.org/docs/python_api/ui_extensions.html) for information on how to get started accessing the python API.
